== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why plugin is not working? =

There are several reasons:

1. Javascript errors on page. Commonly caused by buggy plugins. Check javascript console of your browser. If you find errors, try to locate and fix its source. 
2. No `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` functions in template. Check header.php and footer.php files of your active theme.
3. Conflicts with other plugins and scripts
4. CSS incompatibility

= Why the plugin is not working in Chrome (and other Webkit based browsers)? =

Check your CSS files for these two instructions:
`-webkit-backface-visibility:hidden;
-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);`
If found, disable them and see the result.

= I have a responsive theme. How can I make the plugin compatible with it? =

There are several options to accomplish this task. 
First, is to enable "Screen Max Width" option. 
For example you have a responsive styles: `@media screen and (max-width: 940px) {...}`. Set "Screen Max Width" = 940 - to disable plugin in responsive mode. 
Second, use "Inherit widget width from the parent container" option.  

= How to prevent overlapping with the footer? =

Make sure you have updated plugin to version 2.x. Go to WP admin area, Appearance -> Fixed Widget Options. Here you can define top and bottom margins. Set bottom margin value >= footer height. Check the result.

= Refresh Interval option =

This option defines (in milliseconds, 1 sec = 1000 ms) how often plugin recalculates sticky widgets parameters. Required by sites with dynamic content (infinite scroll, image lazy load and other javascript stuff). The option have impact on the site performance (client side). Recommended values: 250 - 1500 milliseconds. If you don't have dynamic content, set Refresh interval = 0.
